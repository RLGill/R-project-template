# Read Me!

This R notebook contains the following:
* Install and load packages currently in your project's lockfile.
* Add extra packages as your project progresses.
* Do some coding.
* Format all R code in your project.


# Code starts here:

# 00 Packages

```{r Current dependencies}

# Install and load packages in project's lockfile

source("./00-R-code/Install-dependencies.R", chdir = TRUE)

```

```{r Add packages}

# During a coding session ----------------------------------------------------|

# As you progress and need additional packages for your project, install and 
# load them here by following these steps:
# 1. Add names of any packages to the extra_packages() vector below.
# 2. Run this chunk.

# The code:
extra_packages <- c("ggplot2", "ggpubr")
install_packages <- extra_packages[!extra_packages %in% installed.packages()]
for (lib in install_packages) install.packages(lib, dependencies = TRUE)
lapply(extra_packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# After each coding session --------------------------------------------------|

# Save any extra packages in your project's lockfile for future use:
# 1. Navigate to 00-R-code from Files pane > open "Install-dependencies.R".
# 2. Add extra package names to the packages_record() vector.
# 3. Run the script > save & close.
# 4. In this chunk, remove package name(s) from the extra_packages() vector.
# 5. Run this chunk > save.

```


# 01 Code

```{r Coding task}

# I am coding now
# So fun

```


# 02 Style

```{r Format code}

# Warning - run this chunk line by line!

# Select/load a style guide
if (FALSE) {
  
  # First time
  lintr::use_lintr(type = "tidyverse") # Can change the style here

  # Thereafter
  lintr::lint_dir()
}

# Check entire directory
lintr::lint_dir()

# Format all code in your project according to the selected style guide
styler::style_dir("./")

# Manually check the modified code from above to ensure it works and you're
# happy with any change(s).

# Check directory again for changes requiring user modification
lintr::lint_dir()

# Make the manual modification(s) from above

```
